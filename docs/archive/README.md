# Archived Documentation

This directory contains completed implementation plans that have been fully implemented in the codebase.

## Archived Files

| File | Description | Archived Date |

| `DATA_LAYER.md` | Database schema documentation (consolidated into CLAUDE.md) | 2025-12-16 |

## Why Archive?

These plans were moved here because:
1. All features described are **fully implemented** in production
2. The code is the source of truth for current implementation
3. Plans are kept for **historical reference** and documentation audit trails
4. Content has been **consolidated into CLAUDE.md** (single source of truth)

## Current Documentation

For current project documentation, see:
- **[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)** - Single source of truth (includes Data Layer Architecture section with 73 tables)
- **[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md)** - Version history and release notes
