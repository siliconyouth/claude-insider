## System Requirements

Before installing Claude Code, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.0 or higher
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows (via WSL)
- **Terminal**: A modern terminal emulator

## Installation Methods

### Using npm (Recommended)

The fastest way to install Claude Code is via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Using Homebrew (macOS)

If you're on macOS and prefer Homebrew:

```bash
brew install anthropic/tap/claude-code
```

### Using pnpm

For pnpm users:

```bash
pnpm add -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that Claude Code is properly installed:

```bash
claude --version
```

You should see output like:

```
Claude Code v1.x.x
```

## Authentication

Before using Claude Code, you need to authenticate with your Anthropic account:

```bash
claude auth login
```

This will open a browser window where you can sign in with your Anthropic account. Once authenticated, you're ready to start using Claude Code!

## First Run

To start your first Claude Code session:

```bash
claude
```

Or start with a specific prompt:

```bash
claude "Help me understand this codebase"
```

## Updating Claude Code

To update to the latest version:

```bash
npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Or with Homebrew:

```bash
brew upgrade claude-code
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

If you get a "command not found" error after installation, ensure your global npm bin directory is in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(npm bin -g)"
```

Add this line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to make it permanent.

### Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors during installation, you may need to fix npm permissions:

```bash
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```
