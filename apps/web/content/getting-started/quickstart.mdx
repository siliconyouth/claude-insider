description: Get up and running with Claude Code in minutes
---

## Your First Session

After [installing Claude Code](/docs/getting-started/installation), start your first session:

```bash
claude
```

You'll see Claude's prompt waiting for your input. Try asking it to help you understand your current project:

```bash
claude "What does this project do?"
```

## Basic Commands

### Interactive Mode

Start an interactive session where you can have a conversation:

```bash
claude
```

### Single Query

Ask a single question and get a response:

```bash
claude "Explain this function: $(cat myfile.js)"
```

### Working with Files

Claude Code can read and modify files in your project:

```bash
claude "Read the README and summarize it"
claude "Add a new feature to handle user authentication"
```

## Project Context with CLAUDE.md

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root to give Claude context about your project:

```markdown
# Project Overview

This is a Next.js application for managing tasks.

## Key Files

- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main homepage
- `src/lib/db.ts` - Database utilities

## Conventions

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow the existing code style
```

Claude will automatically read this file and use it to provide better assistance.

## Common Workflows

### Code Review

```bash
claude "Review the changes in my last commit"
```

### Bug Fixing

```bash
claude "There's a bug where the form doesn't submit. Can you help debug it?"
```

### Refactoring

```bash
claude "Refactor this component to use React hooks instead of class components"
```

### Documentation

```bash
claude "Add JSDoc comments to the functions in src/utils/"
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific**: Instead of "fix the bug", describe what's happening and what you expect.

2. **Provide context**: Share relevant error messages, logs, or code snippets.

3. **Use the filesystem**: Claude can read files directly, so reference them by path.

4. **Iterate**: If the first response isn't quite right, provide feedback and ask for adjustments.

## Next Steps

- Learn about [CLAUDE.md configuration](/docs/configuration/claude-md)
- Explore [prompting strategies](/docs/tips-and-tricks/prompting)
- Set up [IDE integrations](/docs/integrations/ide-plugins)
