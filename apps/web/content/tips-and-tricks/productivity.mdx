description: Work faster and smarter with Claude Code using these power-user techniques
---

Level up your Claude Code workflow with these productivity tips, keyboard shortcuts, and automation techniques used by power users.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Master these shortcuts to navigate faster:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current operation |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear screen |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate command history |
| `Tab` | Autocomplete file paths |
| `Ctrl+R` | Search command history |
| `Esc` | Dismiss suggestions |

## Quick Commands

### Slash Commands

Use built-in slash commands for common operations:

```bash
/help          # Show available commands
/clear         # Clear conversation history
/compact       # Summarize and compact context
/config        # Open configuration
/model         # Switch Claude model
/cost          # Show token usage and costs
```

### File Operations

```bash
# Read a specific file
"Read src/index.ts"

# Read multiple files
"Read src/api/*.ts"

# Read with line numbers
"Show me lines 50-100 of src/utils/helpers.ts"
```

## Workflow Optimization

### 1. Start with a Plan

Before diving into code, ask Claude to outline the approach:

```
I need to add user authentication. Before writing code:
1. List the files we'll need to create/modify
2. Outline the implementation steps
3. Identify potential challenges

Then we'll implement step by step.
```

### 2. Use Context Files

Create a `.claude/context.md` file for project-specific instructions that persist across sessions:

```markdown
# Project Context

## Quick Commands
- "run tests" → pnpm test
- "start dev" → pnpm dev
- "deploy" → pnpm deploy:prod

## Common Tasks
- New component: Create in src/components/, add story, add test
- New API route: Create in src/app/api/, add validation, add docs
```

### 3. Batch Similar Operations

Instead of making changes one at a time:

```
Update all API route handlers in src/app/api/ to:
1. Add request validation with Zod
2. Add proper error responses
3. Add request logging
4. Add rate limiting middleware

Start with the users routes, then apply the pattern to others.
```

### 4. Create Reusable Prompts

Save common prompts for quick reuse:

**Code Review Prompt:**
```
Review this code for:
- [ ] Type safety
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Performance
- [ ] Security
- [ ] Test coverage
- [ ] Documentation

Provide specific, actionable feedback.
```

**PR Description Prompt:**
```
Generate a PR description for these changes:
- Include a summary of what changed
- List any breaking changes
- Add testing instructions
- Note any deployment considerations
```

## Power User Techniques

### 1. Incremental Building

Build complex features piece by piece:

```
Session 1: "Create the database schema for user profiles"
Session 2: "Add the API routes for CRUD operations"
Session 3: "Build the React components for the profile page"
Session 4: "Add form validation and error handling"
Session 5: "Write tests for the new functionality"
```

### 2. Rubber Duck Debugging

Use Claude to think through problems:

```
I'm stuck on this bug. Let me explain what's happening:

1. User clicks submit
2. Form data is validated (this works)
3. API call is made (this works)
4. Response comes back (this works)
5. UI doesn't update (BUG IS HERE)

Walk me through possible causes.
```

### 3. Learning Mode

Use Claude to understand unfamiliar code:

```
I'm new to this codebase. Explain:
1. The overall architecture
2. How data flows from frontend to database
3. The key abstractions and patterns used
4. Where to find things I might need to modify
```

### 4. Template Generation

Create templates for consistency:

```
Generate a template for a new React component that follows
our project conventions:
- TypeScript with Props interface
- Styled with Tailwind
- Includes basic accessibility
- Has a Storybook story
- Has a test file

I'll use this as a starting point for new components.
```

## Session Management

### Starting Fresh

Clear context when starting a new task:

```
/clear

Starting fresh. New task: [describe your task]
Relevant files: [list key files]
```

### Resuming Work

When returning to a previous task:

```
Continuing from yesterday. We were implementing user authentication.
Progress so far:
- ✅ Database schema
- ✅ API routes
- 🔄 Frontend components (in progress)
- ⏳ Testing

Let's continue with the frontend components.
```

### Context Compaction

For long sessions, compact the context:

```
/compact

We've been working on the payment integration.
Key decisions made:
- Using Stripe for payments
- Webhooks for async updates
- Storing transaction logs in PostgreSQL

Continue with: webhook handler implementation
```

## Automation Ideas

### Git Workflow

```
After making these changes:
1. Create a meaningful commit message
2. Show me what files changed
3. Suggest a branch name if we're not on a feature branch
```

### Documentation

```
For any new public function I write today,
automatically suggest JSDoc comments.
```

### Testing

```
After implementing each feature, suggest test cases we should add.
Focus on edge cases and error conditions.
```

## Time-Saving Patterns

### 1. The "Apply Everywhere" Pattern

```
I've updated the Button component to use the new design system.
Find all other components using the old button styles and update them.
```

### 2. The "Explain Then Execute" Pattern

```
Before making changes, explain what you plan to do.
I'll confirm, then you execute.
This helps catch misunderstandings early.
```

### 3. The "Checkpoint" Pattern

```
Let's checkpoint here. Summarize:
- What we've accomplished
- What's left to do
- Any blockers or concerns

Then continue with the next task.
```

### 4. The "Scope Limit" Pattern

```
Let's timebox this refactoring to just the auth module.
Don't touch other parts of the codebase yet.
We'll expand scope after this is working.
```

## Daily Workflows

### Morning Routine

```
Good morning! Let's start the day:
1. What were we working on yesterday?
2. Any failed CI/CD pipelines to check?
3. What's the priority for today?
```

### Before Commits

```
Pre-commit checklist:
1. Run the linter
2. Run the tests
3. Check for console.logs or debug code
4. Review the diff one more time
```

### End of Day

```
Wrap up for today:
1. Save current progress
2. Note any blockers for tomorrow
3. Update task status
4. Create a brief summary of what was done
```
