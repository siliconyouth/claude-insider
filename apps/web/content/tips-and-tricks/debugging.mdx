Claude Code excels at helping you find and fix bugs. This guide covers techniques for effective debugging sessions, from simple errors to complex issues.

## Debugging Workflow

### 1. Describe the Problem

Be specific about what's happening:

```
The login form submits but nothing happens.
Expected: Redirect to dashboard after successful login
Actual: Form clears but user stays on login page
No errors in console
```

### 2. Share the Error

When you have error messages, share them in full:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'user')
    at AuthContext.tsx:45:23
    at renderWithHooks (react-dom.development.js:14985:18)
```

### 3. Let Claude Investigate

Claude can search for relevant code:

```
Look at the AuthContext component around line 45.
What's causing the undefined 'user' error?
```

## Common Debugging Patterns

### Pattern 1: Error-First Debugging

Start with the error message:

```
I'm getting this error:
"ReferenceError: process is not defined"

The error occurs when I run the app in the browser.
Using Next.js 14 with App Router.
```

Claude will:
- Identify the root cause (server-only code in client component)
- Suggest specific fixes
- Explain why the error occurs

### Pattern 2: Behavior Debugging

When there's no error, describe the behavior:

```
The shopping cart total doesn't update when I change quantities.
- Adding items works fine
- Removing items works fine
- Changing quantity shows the new number but total stays the same
```

### Pattern 3: Performance Debugging

For slow code or memory issues:

```
The dashboard takes 5+ seconds to load.
It was fast before I added the recent activity feed.
Here's the component: src/components/RecentActivity.tsx
```

### Pattern 4: Regression Debugging

When something that worked breaks:

```
The export feature stopped working after updating to v2.0.
It was working in commit abc123.
Now it throws "Invalid file format" error.
```

## Debugging Strategies

### Binary Search with Git

Find when a bug was introduced:

```
Help me find when this bug was introduced.
The feature works in commit from last week (abc123).
It's broken in current main (def456).
Use git bisect to narrow it down.
```

### Minimal Reproduction

Ask Claude to isolate the problem:

```
The bug only happens sometimes.
Help me create a minimal reproduction case
that triggers it consistently.
```

### Log-Based Debugging

When you can't step through code:

```
Add strategic console.log statements to trace
the data flow through the payment processing pipeline.
I need to see where the discount calculation goes wrong.
```

## Framework-Specific Debugging

### React Debugging

```
The component re-renders infinitely.
I think it's a useEffect dependency issue.
Check src/components/UserProfile.tsx

Also check if any parent components might be
causing unnecessary re-renders.
```

### API Debugging

```
The API returns 500 but only for certain users.
Check the error logs and identify the pattern.
Looking at src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts
```

### State Management Debugging

```
The Redux store has the correct data,
but the component shows stale values.
Check if the selector is memoized correctly.
```

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Conditional Breakpoints with Logging

```
I can't use a debugger in production.
Add conditional logging that only fires when:
- User ID is 12345
- Amount is over $100
- The discount code is "SPECIAL"
```

### Network Request Debugging

```
The API call works in Postman but fails in the app.
Compare the exact headers, body, and request format.
Check for any request interceptors or middleware.
```

### Memory Leak Detection

```
The app slows down after extended use.
Help me identify potential memory leaks:
- Event listeners not being removed
- Subscriptions not being cancelled
- Large objects being held in closures
```

## Debugging Best Practices

### 1. Reproduce First

Before fixing, ensure you can reproduce:

```
Help me write a test case that reproduces this bug
so we can verify the fix works.
```

### 2. Understand Before Fixing

Ask Claude to explain the issue:

```
Before we fix this, explain what's causing
the null reference at line 145.
I want to understand the root cause.
```

### 3. One Fix at a Time

Avoid multiple changes:

```
Let's fix the authentication bug first.
Don't change the validation logic yet -
we need to isolate whether auth is the problem.
```

### 4. Test the Fix

After fixing:

```
Now that we've fixed it:
1. Run the existing tests
2. Add a test for this specific bug
3. Check for any related edge cases
```

## Debugging Prompts Collection

### Initial Investigation

```
I have a bug in [feature]. Here's what I know:
- Expected behavior: [...]
- Actual behavior: [...]
- Error message (if any): [...]
- When it started: [...]

Please investigate the relevant code and suggest
what might be causing this.
```

### Narrowing Down

```
We've identified the bug is in the [module].
The issue happens between [step A] and [step B].
Look at the code flow and find exactly where
the data gets corrupted/lost/changed incorrectly.
```

### Fix Verification

```
I've applied the fix. Please:
1. Review the change for correctness
2. Check for edge cases I might have missed
3. Suggest any additional tests needed
4. Look for similar patterns elsewhere that might have the same bug
```

### Root Cause Analysis

```
We fixed the immediate issue, but I want to
understand how this happened.
- Why wasn't this caught earlier?
- Are there similar patterns in the codebase?
- What can we do to prevent this type of bug?
```

## When You're Stuck

### Rubber Duck Debugging

Use Claude as your rubber duck:

```
Let me explain what this code is supposed to do,
step by step. Stop me if anything sounds wrong:

1. User clicks submit
2. Form data is collected into an object
3. We validate required fields
4. API call is made with the data
5. On success, we redirect to /dashboard
```

### Fresh Perspective

```
I've been staring at this for hours.
Please look at the authentication flow with fresh eyes.
Something obvious might be wrong that I'm missing.
```

### Systematic Review

```
Let's systematically check each component
in the data pipeline, from input to database:
1. Form submission
2. API route handler
3. Validation middleware
4. Database query
5. Response handling
```
