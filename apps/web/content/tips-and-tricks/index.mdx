Get the most out of Claude Code with these expert tips, prompting strategies, and productivity hacks. Whether you're a beginner or power user, these techniques will help you work more efficiently.

## Quick Wins

### Be Specific About Context

Instead of:
```
Fix the bug
```

Try:
```
Fix the bug in src/auth/login.ts where users can't log in
with email addresses containing plus signs. The validation
regex on line 42 is too restrictive.
```

### Use File References

Claude can read files directly. Reference them by path:

```
Read src/components/Button.tsx and add a loading state prop
```

### Chain Operations

Combine multiple requests:

```
1. Add TypeScript types to src/utils/helpers.js
2. Rename the file to helpers.ts
3. Update all imports across the project
```

## Pro Tips

### 1. Start with the Goal

Tell Claude what you want to achieve, not just what to do:

```
I want to improve the performance of the product listing page.
Currently it loads 500+ products at once and is slow.
Suggest and implement pagination or virtual scrolling.
```

### 2. Provide Examples

When asking for specific output formats:

```
Generate API documentation for src/api/users.ts in this format:

## GET /users/:id
**Description**: Fetches a user by ID
**Parameters**:
- id (string): User identifier
**Response**: User object
```

### 3. Use Constraints

Be explicit about limitations:

```
Refactor this function but:
- Keep the same public API
- Don't add new dependencies
- Maintain backward compatibility with Node 16
```

### 4. Leverage Git Context

Claude understands git. Use it:

```
Review my uncommitted changes and suggest improvements
```

```
What changed in the last 3 commits that might have caused the test failures?
```

### 5. Break Down Complex Tasks

For large changes, work incrementally:

```
Let's add user authentication to this app. Start by:
1. Listing what we'll need to add
2. Then we'll implement each part step by step
```

## Common Patterns

### Code Review

```
Review src/services/payment.ts for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Error handling gaps
- Performance issues
- Code style consistency
```

### Debugging

```
This test is failing intermittently:
[paste test output]

The test file is tests/api/orders.test.ts
Help me identify the race condition.
```

### Documentation

```
Add JSDoc comments to all exported functions in src/lib/
Focus on parameter descriptions and return types.
```

### Refactoring

```
The UserService class (src/services/user.ts) has grown to 800 lines.
Help me split it into smaller, focused services while maintaining
the same public interface.
```
