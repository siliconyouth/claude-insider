title: CLAUDE.md Guide
description: Master the CLAUDE.md file format to give Claude perfect context about your projects
---

The `CLAUDE.md` file is the primary way to provide Claude Code with context about your project. When you start a session, Claude automatically reads these files to understand your codebase, conventions, and preferences.

## Why Use CLAUDE.md?

Without context, Claude has to infer information about your project from the code itself. With a well-crafted `CLAUDE.md`, you can:

- **Reduce repetition** - No need to explain your stack every session
- **Ensure consistency** - Claude follows your conventions automatically
- **Speed up workflows** - Claude understands your project structure immediately
- **Improve accuracy** - Better context leads to better suggestions

## File Location

Claude Code looks for `CLAUDE.md` files in several locations:

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md           # Global defaults (all projects)
~/projects/my-app/CLAUDE.md   # Project root (most common)
~/projects/my-app/src/CLAUDE.md  # Directory-specific
```

**Precedence**: Directory-specific > Project root > Global

## Basic Structure

A typical `CLAUDE.md` includes these sections:

```markdown
# Project Name

## Overview
Brief description of what this project does.

## Tech Stack
- Framework and version
- Key libraries
- Database/services

## Project Structure
Key directories and their purposes.

## Coding Conventions
Style guide, patterns, naming conventions.

## Common Tasks
Frequent operations and how to perform them.
```

## Complete Example

Here's a comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` for a Next.js project:

```markdown
# E-Commerce Platform

## Overview
A full-stack e-commerce platform built with Next.js,
featuring product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.x
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js with Google/GitHub providers
- **Payments**: Stripe

## Project Structure
\`\`\`
src/
├── app/              # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/       # React components
│   ├── ui/          # Reusable UI components
│   └── features/    # Feature-specific components

└── styles/          # Global styles
\`\`\`

## Coding Conventions

### Components
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Props interface named `{ComponentName}Props`
- Export components as named exports
- Co-locate component styles and tests

### Naming
- Components: PascalCase (`ProductCard.tsx`)
- Utilities: camelCase (`formatPrice.ts`)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- CSS classes: kebab-case

### State Management
- Server state: React Query
- Client state: Zustand for global, useState for local
- Form state: React Hook Form

## Database

### Running Migrations
\`\`\`bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev    # Development
pnpm prisma migrate deploy # Production
\`\`\`

### Seeding
\`\`\`bash
pnpm prisma db seed
\`\`\`

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Page
1. Create file in `src/app/[route]/page.tsx`
2. Add metadata export for SEO
3. Create associated components in `src/components/features/`

### Adding a New API Route
1. Create file in `src/app/api/[route]/route.ts`
2. Use `NextResponse` for responses
3. Add Zod schema for validation

## Environment Variables
Required variables in `.env.local`:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Auth encryption key
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe API key

## Testing
\`\`\`bash
pnpm test        # Run all tests
pnpm test:watch  # Watch mode
pnpm test:cov    # With coverage
\`\`\`

## Deployment
- Main branch auto-deploys to production
- PRs create preview deployments
- Run `pnpm build` locally to verify before pushing
```

## Section Deep Dive

### Overview Section

Keep it concise but informative:

```markdown
## Overview
A real-time collaborative document editor supporting
multiple users, rich text formatting, and version history.
Built for teams who need Google Docs-like functionality
with self-hosting capabilities.
```

### Tech Stack Section

List versions for accuracy:

```markdown
## Tech Stack
- React 18.2 with TypeScript 5.3
- Vite 5.0 for bundling
- TanStack Query v5 for data fetching
- Tailwind CSS 3.4
- Vitest for testing
```

### Conventions Section

Be specific about patterns:

```markdown
## Conventions

### Error Handling
- Use custom `AppError` class for application errors
- Wrap async route handlers with `asyncHandler`
- Log errors to Sentry in production

### API Responses
Always return consistent shape:
\`\`\`typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: { code: string; message: string };
}
\`\`\`
```

## Directory-Specific Overrides

Create `CLAUDE.md` files in subdirectories for specialized instructions:

### `tests/CLAUDE.md`
```markdown
# Test Directory

## Testing Conventions
- Use `describe` blocks for grouping
- Name tests: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
- Mock external services, not internal modules
- Aim for >80% coverage on business logic
```

### `scripts/CLAUDE.md`
```markdown
# Scripts Directory

## Script Conventions
- Scripts should be idempotent when possible
- Include --dry-run flag for destructive operations
- Log progress to stdout, errors to stderr
- Exit with appropriate codes (0 success, 1 error)
```

## Tips for Effective CLAUDE.md

1. **Update regularly** - Keep it in sync with your project
2. **Be specific** - Vague instructions lead to vague results
3. **Include examples** - Show don't just tell
4. **Document gotchas** - Warn about common pitfalls
5. **Keep it readable** - Use clear headings and formatting

## Common Patterns

### For APIs
```markdown
## API Design
- RESTful endpoints under `/api/v1/`
- Use HTTP verbs correctly (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Return appropriate status codes
- Include pagination for list endpoints
```

### For CLI Tools
```markdown
## CLI Conventions
- Use Commander.js for argument parsing
- Support both `--flag` and `-f` short forms
- Provide helpful `--help` output
- Use chalk for colored output
```

### For Libraries
```markdown
## Library Guidelines
- Maintain backward compatibility in minor versions
- Document all public APIs with JSDoc
- Include TypeScript declarations
- Provide migration guides for breaking changes
```
