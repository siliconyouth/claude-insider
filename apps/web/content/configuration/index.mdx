Claude Code offers flexible configuration options to customize its behavior for your specific needs. From project-level settings in CLAUDE.md files to global preferences, you have full control over how Claude assists you.

## Configuration Options

### CLAUDE.md Files

The most powerful way to configure Claude Code is through `CLAUDE.md` files. These Markdown files provide project-specific context and instructions that Claude reads automatically.

```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md          # Project root configuration
├── src/
│   └── CLAUDE.md      # Directory-specific overrides
└── tests/
    └── CLAUDE.md      # Test-specific instructions
```

### Settings & Preferences

Claude Code stores user preferences and settings that persist across sessions:

- **Model selection** - Choose your preferred Claude model
- **Output formatting** - Customize how responses are displayed
- **Safety settings** - Configure approval requirements for file changes
- **Theme preferences** - Set your preferred color scheme

## Quick Configuration Examples

### Basic Project Setup

Create a `CLAUDE.md` at your project root:

```markdown
# Project: My Web App

## Overview
This is a Next.js application with TypeScript.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Prisma ORM

## Conventions
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing code style
- Write tests for new features
```

### Monorepo Configuration

For monorepos, you can have configuration at multiple levels:

```markdown
# Monorepo Root CLAUDE.md

## Structure
- apps/web - Main web application
- apps/api - Backend API
- packages/ui - Shared components

## Guidelines
- Changes to packages/ require updating dependent apps
- Run tests before committing: `pnpm test`
```

## Environment Variables

Some Claude Code features can be configured via environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Your API key for Claude |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | Default model to use |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | Custom config directory |

## Best Practices

1. **Keep CLAUDE.md updated** - As your project evolves, update the configuration
2. **Be specific** - Clear instructions lead to better assistance
3. **Use directory-level configs** - Override settings for specific parts of your codebase
4. **Document conventions** - Help Claude understand your coding standards
